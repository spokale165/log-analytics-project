# 📊 Log Analytics Project

A learning-oriented **log analytics platform** built from scratch using open-source tools.  
The system demonstrates how microservices generate structured logs, how those logs are ingested, stored, visualized, and used for real-time alerting.

## 🚀 Current Progress
- **Backend (Spring Boot)**
  - Dummy services: Payment, Order, Auth
  - Exposed REST endpoints with DTOs
  - Structured logging (SLF4J + JSON)
  - Actuator endpoints for health and mappings
- **Docs**
  - Project plan (8 phases)
  - Interview Q&A
  - System design diagrams

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (planned)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Kafka/RabbitMQ
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch
- **Frontend:** React.js, Recharts, Tailwind
- **Infra:** Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana
- **Alerting:** Email, Jira, Slack

## 📍 Roadmap
1. Project scaffolding & infra
2. Dummy services ✅
3. Ingestion pipeline (next)
4. Storage & indexing
5. Alerting & automation
6. Frontend visualization
7. Observability & security
8. Deployment & runbooks
